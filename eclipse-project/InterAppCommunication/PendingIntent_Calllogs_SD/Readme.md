The tasks contain apps that form possible combinations of activity, service and broadcast receivers to read call logs and save them into sd card through pending intent( wrapping explicit and implicit intents). They act as source and sink and the summary in each folder contains details of the flow of the task. Along with that, each source app has a readme file to explain its working. Hence, this project is providing a dataset for studying behavior of different devices under different internal scenarios.
