DroidBench is an open test suite for evaluating the effectiveness of taint-analysis tools specifically for Android apps. 
The suite can be used to assess both static and dynamic taint analyses, but in particular it contains test cases for interesting static-analysis problems (field sensitivity, object sensitivity, tradeoffs in access-path lengths etc.) as well as for Android-specific challenges like correctly modeling an applicationâ€™s lifecycle, adequately handling asynchronous callbacks and interacting with the UI.

The distribution contains an eclipse workspace with all source-code projects as well as readily compiled APKs.

DroidBench was created by Christian Fritz, Steven Arzt and Siegfried Rasthofer of the [EC SPRIDE Secure Software Engineering Group](http://sse.ec-spride.de/).
Another Java-based benchmark-suite with the same aim as DroidBench is [SecuriBench](http://suif.stanford.edu/~livshits/work/securibench/index.html) which focuses on Web-based applications written in Java.

We welcome your contributions!

Version 2.0
===========
Version 2.0 comprises the following 120 test cases:

Aliasing <img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>
---------

* **Merge1**: Sensitive data is assigned to a heap object which is then shuffled around. Only constant data is leaked.

Arrays and Lists
----------------
* **ArrayAccess1**: Stores both a tainted and an untainted value in an array and then leaks the untainted one. Array indices are constants.
* **ArrayAccess2**: Stores both a tainted and an untainted value in an array and then leaks the untainted one. Array indices are calculated.
* **ArrayCopy1**: Stores a tainted value in an array and then uses System.arraycopy to copy the data to a new array which is then leaked to log. <img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>
* **ArrayToString1**: IMEI is stored in an array of String which is then converted back to String using Arrays.toString(). <img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>
* **HashMapAccess1**: Stores both a tainted and an untainted value in a hash map and then leaks the untainted one. Map keys are constants.
* **ListAccess1**: Both a tainted and an untainted value are stored in a list. Only the untainted value is leaked.
* **MultidimensionalArray1**: Stores a tainted value in a 2-dimensional array and accesses it through a reference pointing to a slice containing the tainted value. <img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>

Callbacks
---------
* **AnonymousClass1**: Registers a callback handler for location updates in an anonymous inner class and leaks the incoming location data inside the callback.
* **Button1**: The sink is called after the user clicks a button. The button handler is defined via XML.
* **Button2**: Only clicking buttons in a specific order leads to a data leak.
* **Button3**: A new callback is registered in another callback's handler. The second handler leaks the data obtained by the first handler.
* **Button4**: The sink is called after the user clicks a button. The button handler is defined via XML using an include directive.
* **Button5**: IMEI is obtained during Activity's onCreate() and is later leaked through onClick's callback defined in layout's xml. Note that the first click only stores the IMEI into the button's hint. Only the second click actually leaks it.
* **LocationLeak1**: Registers a listener for location updates, stores the value and leaks it later in the lifecycle.
* **LocationLeak2**: Similar to LocationLeak1, but the activity class directly implements the callback interface.
* **LocationLeak3**: Similar to LocationLeak1, but the callback handler is in a dedicated class decoupled from the activity using an interface.
* **MethodOverride1**: Overwrites an internal Android method to hide a leak.
* **MultiHandlers1**: Contains two activities and two handlers that do not leak any data if the correct activity is used with the correct handler.
* **Ordering1**: Leaks variable contents before the handler initializing them is even registered.
* **RegisterGlobal1**: Both source and sink are part of a global (application-level) lifecycle handler.
* **Unregister1**: Registers and directly unregisters a callback before it can be invoked. The code in the callback can thus never leak any data.

Field and Object Sensitivity
----------------------------
* **FieldSensitivity1**: Both tainted and untainted data is stored in a data object; the untainted value is leaked.
* **FieldSensitivity2**: Similar to FieldSensitivity1, but source and sink calls are distributed across the lifecycle.
* **FieldSensitivity3**: Both tainted and untainted data is stored in a data object; the tainted value is leaked. Source and sink calls are distributed across the lifecycle.
* **FieldSensitivity4**: Field contents are sent before tainting the field.
* **InheritedObjects1**: Chooses an object's actual type based on a conditional. Only one possible type leads to a leak.
* **ObjectSensitivity1**: Writes a tainted value into an object and an untainted one into another object of the same type. Leaks the untainted value.
* **ObjectSensitivity2**: Writes a tainted value into a field and then overwrites it with untainted data.

Inter-App Communication
------------------------------------------
* **Echoer**: Receives data and echoes it back to the sender.
* **SendSMS**: Reads the Device ID, passes it through Echoer, and then sends it in a text message.
* **StartActivityForResult1**: Reads the user's geographical location (via GPS), passes it through Echoer, and then writes it to a file.

Inter-Component Communication <img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>
------------------------------
* **ActivityCommunication1**: Contains two activities that communicate using static fields.
* **ActivityCommunication2**: IMEI is obtained in one Activity and stored in an Intent's extra for starting the next Activity which will then leak IMEI to log.
* **ActivityCommunication3**: Another Activity is started using class name.  IEMI is leaked in the Activity to be started.
* **ActivityCommunication4**: An Intent for starting another Activity is created by concatenating two constant strings.  The Activity to be started leaks the IMEI which was passed in as the Intent's extra.   
* **ActivityCommunication5**: A Activity is started using constant component's Name and Intent.setComponent. The started Activity leaks the IMEI to log.
* **ActivityCommunication6**: An Intent to start another Activity is passed through LinkedList's add() and retrieved with LinkedList.get().  The retrieved Intent is used to start a leaking Activity.
* **ActivityCommunication7**: An Activity class is created and its classname is retrieved using getClass() on the instance object.  The classname is then used to start the second Activity which then leaks IMEI information form Intent's extra.
* **ActivityCommunication8**: An action for the Intent to start another Activity is passed through and retrieved with LinkedList.get().  The retrieved String is used to start the leaking Activity.
* **BroadcastTaintAndLeak1**:  IMEI is obtained in an Activity and stored in the Intent's extra of the Intent to the BroadcastReceiver which was registered programmatically.  The Receiver leaks the IMEI info.
* **ComponentNotInManifest1**: IMEI is obtained in one Activity and is stored in the Intent's to start a leaking Activity which is not in the AndroidManifest.xml.  No leak happens as it is not valid.
* **EventOrdering1**: IMEI is obtained and stored in the SharedPreferences of the secondary Activity (InFlowActivity).  The first Activity (OutFlowActivity) starts the second Activity.  The second-time the 2nd Activity is started, IMEI is leaked to log.
* **IntentSink1**: A tainted value is leaked as the result of an activity.
* **IntentSink2**: Similar to IntentSink, but the value is sent out in a callback method defined in XML.
* **IntentSource1**: Two tainted leaks: the first one is that a tainted value is leaked to another app using an intent by startActivityForResult. The other one is that onActivityResult method gets intent as tainted data and then logs it.
* **ServiceCommunication1**: IMEI is obtained and sent to a Service which then leaks the info in the Messenger's Handler.  
* **SharedPreferences1**:  IMEI is obtained in the one Activity and stored in the SharedPreferences which is leaked by another Activity.
* **Singletons1**: IMEI is stored in a singleton object in one Activity and leaked in a different Activity.
* **UnresolvableIntent1**:  The app tries to start an Activity int an Intent that cannot be resolved statically.  One of the two Activities may be started based on a random boolean, and both of them leak IMEI from the starting Activity to log.
