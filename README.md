</p>
DroidBench is an open test suite for evaluating the effectiveness of taint-analysis tools specifically for Android apps. 
The suite can be used to assess both static and dynamic taint analyses, but in particular it contains test cases for interesting static-analysis problems (field sensitivity, object sensitivity, tradeoffs in access-path lengths etc.) as well as for Android-specific challenges like correctly modeling an application's lifecycle, adequately handling asynchronous callbacks and interacting with the UI.

The distribution contains an eclipse workspace with all source-code projects as well as readily compiled APKs.

DroidBench was created by Christian Fritz, Steven Arzt and Siegfried Rasthofer of the [EC SPRIDE Secure Software Engineering Group](http://sse.ec-spride.de/).
Another Java-based benchmark-suite with the same aim as DroidBench is [SecuriBench](http://suif.stanford.edu/~livshits/work/securibench/index.html) which focuses on Web-based applications written in Java.

We welcome your contributions!

**You are most welcome to contribute additional test cases to DroidBench.** To do so, please fork the project, commit an appropriate Eclipse source project and APK, update this README and then send us a pull request.

Version 3.0-develop
====================

Version 3.0-develop comprises the following 190 test cases:

Aliasing
---------

* **FlowSensitivity1**: Sensitive data is assigned to a heap object. Only after calling the sink, an alias between the leaked object and the tainted one is created.<img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>
* **Merge1**: Sensitive data is assigned to a heap object which is then shuffled around. Only constant data is leaked.
* **SimpleAliasing1**: Sensitive data is assigned to a heap object and leaked through an alias.<img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>
* **StrongUpdate1**: Sensitive data is assigned to a heap object, but then overwritten before it is leaked.<img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>

Arrays and Lists
----------------
* **ArrayAccess1**: Stores both a tainted and an untainted value in an array and then leaks the untainted one. Array indices are constants.
* **ArrayAccess2**: Stores both a tainted and an untainted value in an array and then leaks the untainted one. Array indices are calculated.
* **ArrayAccess3**: Sensitive data is written into an array, read back again, and leaked.<img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/> 
* **ArrayAccess4**: Sensitive data is written into a field of an object, this object is then stored in an array and read back again. The field that gets passed to the sink, is however, a different one 	than the one that was tainted.<img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>
* **ArrayAccess5**: Sensitive data is written into an array, but only the constant size of the array is leaked, not the data itself.<img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>
* **ArrayCopy1**: Stores a tainted value in an array and then uses System.arraycopy to copy the data to a new array which is then leaked to log.
* **ArrayToString1**: IMEI is stored in an array of String which is then converted back to String using Arrays.toString().
* **HashMapAccess1**: Stores both a tainted and an untainted value in a hash map and then leaks the untainted one. Map keys are constants.
* **ListAccess1**: Both a tainted and an untainted value are stored in a list. Only the untainted value is leaked.
* **MultidimensionalArray1**: Stores a tainted value in a 2-dimensional array and accesses it through a reference pointing to a slice containing the tainted value.

Callbacks
---------
* **AnonymousClass1**: Registers a callback handler for location updates in an anonymous inner class and leaks the incoming location data inside the callback.
* **Button1**: The sink is called after the user clicks a button. The button handler is defined via XML.
* **Button2**: Only clicking buttons in a specific order leads to a data leak.
* **Button3**: A new callback is registered in another callback's handler. The second handler leaks the data obtained by the first handler.
* **Button4**: The sink is called after the user clicks a button. The button handler is defined via XML using an include directive.
* **Button5**: IMEI is obtained during Activity's onCreate() and is later leaked through onClick's callback defined in layout's xml. Note that the first click only stores the IMEI into the button's hint. Only the second click actually leaks it.
* **LocationLeak1**: Registers a listener for location updates, stores the value and leaks it later in the lifecycle.
* **LocationLeak2**: Similar to LocationLeak1, but the activity class directly implements the callback interface.
* **LocationLeak3**: Similar to LocationLeak1, but the callback handler is in a dedicated class decoupled from the activity using an interface.
* **MethodOverride1**: Overwrites an internal Android method to hide a leak.
* **MultiHandlers1**: Contains two activities and two handlers that do not leak any data if the correct activity is used with the correct handler.
* **Ordering1**: Leaks variable contents before the handler initializing them is even registered.
* **RegisterGlobal1**: Both source and sink are part of a global (application-level) lifecycle handler.
* **Unregister1**: Registers and directly unregisters a callback before it can be invoked. The code in the callback can thus never leak any data.

Dynamic Code Loading<img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>
---------------------

* **CommonLibrary1**: Not a test case on its own, part of the other dynamic code loading test cases. It contains the base class for the actual class that implements source and sink.

* **FieldSensitivity2**: Similar to FieldSensitivity1, but source and sink calls are distributed across the lifecycle.
* **FieldSensitivity3**: Both tainted and untainted data is stored in a data object; the tainted value is leaked. Source and sink calls are distributed across the lifecycle.
* **FieldSensitivity4**: Field contents are sent before tainting the field.
* **InheritedObjects1**: Chooses an object's actual type based on a conditional. Only one possible type leads to a leak.
* **ObjectSensitivity1**: Writes a tainted value into an object and an untainted one into another object of the same type. Leaks the untainted value.
* **ObjectSensitivity2**: Writes a tainted value into a field and then overwrites it with untainted data.

Inter-App Communication
------------------------------------------
The first test set contains three apps. The StartActivityForResult1 app obtains the sensitive data, and sends it to the Echoer app. The Echoer sends it on to the SendSMS app where it is finally leaked.

* **Echoer**: Receives data and echoes it back to the sender.
* **SendSMS**: Reads the Device ID, passes it through Echoer, and then sends it in a text message.
* **StartActivityForResult1**: Reads the user's geographical location (via GPS), passes it through Echoer, and then writes it to a file.

The second test set contains multiple apps that obtain sensitive data and send it to the Collector app where the data is leaked.

 * the content provider, sent to the Collector app.<img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>
* **DeviceId_OrderedIntent1**: The device id is obtained and sent to a broadcast receiver in the current app. There are multiple broadcast receivers with different priorities. Only the higher-priority receiver relays the data to the Collector app, the lower-priority receiver only shows the data to the user (no leak).<img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>
* **DeviceId_Service1**: This app starts a service which sends the device id to the Collector app where it is leaked.<img src="https://raw.github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/develop/new.gif"/>

Inter-Component Communication
------------------------------

* **BroadcastTaintAndLeak1**:  IMEI is obtained in an Activity and stored in the Intent's extra of the Intent to the BroadcastReceiver which was registered programmatically.  The Receiver leaks the IMEI info.
* **ComponentNotInManifest1**: IMEI is obtained in one Activity and is stored in the Intent's to start a leaking Activity which is not in the AndroidManifest.xml.  No leak happens as it is not valid.
* **EventOrdering1**: IMEI is obtained and stored in the SharedPreferences of the secondary Activity (InFlowActivity).  The first Activity (OutFlowActivity) starts the second Activity.  The second-time the 2nd Activity is started, IMEI is leaked to log.
